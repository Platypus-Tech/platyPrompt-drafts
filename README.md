# Command Line OS drafts

## About

This is a special command line for Platypus OS, with the name still in development. It is going to be one of 3 or 4 command line interfaces, with the others being:

  1. Bash shell
  2. CROSH, which nobody knows how to use, due to a lack of documentation
  3. The Minecraft one, Brigadier
This one is going to have good documentation, unlike CROSH. (If there is good, simple documentation on CROSH, tell me please?).

## Use

Logging in, simple actions, text editing, scripting, booting up the system. Basically, all the important stuff.

## Errorrrrs

There are going to be errors. It's inevitable. So if you find them, change the code, report in issues, do a fork, branch, whatever. Just fix them.
